# Exam in Advanced Programming

This is the repository containing my solution for the final exam in the Advanced Programming (2018) course on the master's degree in computer science at the University of Copenhagen.

## `handout`
The `handout` folder contains the files and information given to us at the start of the exam. These were not done by me and haven't been altered since they were published.

## `handin`
The `handin` folder contains my solution for the exam. All of this (except the stuff that was already given in `handout`) was made by me.

## `report`
The `report` folder contains the written report for the exam (written in LaTeX). The compiled report would be put in a zipfile along with the `handin` folder and handed in.
