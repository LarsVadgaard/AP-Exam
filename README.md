# Exam in Advanced Programming

This is the repository containing my solution for the final exam in the Advanced Programming (2018) course on the master's degree at the University of Copenhagen.

## `handout`
The `handout` folder contains the files and information given to us at the start of the exam. These were not done by me and haven't been altered since they were published.

## `handin`
The `handin` folder contains my solution for the exam. All of this (except the stuff that was given in `handout` was made by me.

The date in the report is recent, as I had to compileit again because it was never added to the repo.
